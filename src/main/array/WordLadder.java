/**
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation
 * sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Only one letter can be changed at a time</li>
 * <li>Each intermediate word must exist in the word list</li>
 * </ol>
 * For example,
 * <p>
 * Given:<br>
 * beginWord = "hit"<br>
 * endWord = "cog"<br>
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]<br>
 * As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",<br>
 * return its length 5.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.</li>
 * <li>All words have the same length.</li>
 * <li>All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.</li>
 * </ul>
